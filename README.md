# Odin Recursion

My submission for The Odin Project's assignement [Project: Recursion](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-recursion)

## Fibonacci

**fibs()** uses a loop to return an array of the fibonacci sequance of a given size.
**fibs_rec()** solves this problem recursively.

## Merge Sort

**merge_sort()** uses the recursive merge sort algorithm to sort an array. 
The array is repeatedly split in half until each peice is only one element. 
The sub-arrays are then merged into each other by placing the smaller elements 
from each sub-array before the larger. The sorted sub-arrays are then merged together
until the whole array has been sorted.
